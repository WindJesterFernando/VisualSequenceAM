///What's the porblem?
//
//This entire thing is an actionSequence
//TimedAction
//
//Perform actions in a sequence
//Define an action - takes time and has an end - is a class, abstact/virtual, many children classes
//Action child classes have more definition.
//??repeatable???
//
//
//iterate on TimedAction class to make pure astract
//
//
//spit out text in debug log
//spit out text one letter at a time
//delay between previous action and next action
//zoom in camera
//move camera
//darken lights
//sprite frame change
//play voiceline
//change lighting color
//
//
//enemy frame animation
//spawn additonal animating sprite
//dmg text
//perform the dmg-ing effect onto characters
//
//move sprite
//
//

//make it so it takes time to complete action and between actions
//do we need to know what the previous/next action was?
//
//order
//a list of actions, that we perform in the order that inputed into the list
//the actionSequence (the list of actions), performs + something-smethig time
//
